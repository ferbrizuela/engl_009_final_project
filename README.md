# engl_009_final_project
This is a computational text analysis project for ENGL 009: Intro to Digital Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania. This repository contains my final data story, data analysis, and how I initially built my corpus. 

In the repository you can find: 

* `final_data_story.ipynb`: This is a notebook with all the information regarding my process in this project, with analysis, interpretation, and findings.
* `data`: This folder contains the notebooks in which I built and cleaned my corpora, as well as my raw and clean data files, marked as such. 
* `data_analysis`: This folder contains a number of notebooks with the different steps in my data analysis, some of which I incorporated into my final data story. Even though not all steps were used in the final story, there are a number of interesting findings within these notebooks!

Thank you for taking the time to look through my project. Each folder has an additional README file detailing the content of the folders and the purpose of each notebook. I invite you to look within the data analysis notebooks (in addition to the final data story) for more information into how I conducted my analysis. Thanks again and I hope you enjoy looking through the project as much as I enjoyed working on it!
