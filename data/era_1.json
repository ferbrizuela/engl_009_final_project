you're mine\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you'll say\nDon't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong\nAnd your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong\nAnd I'll fight their doubt and give you faith\nWith this song for you\n\n[Breakdown]\n'Cause I love the gap between your teeth\nAnd I love the riddles that you speak\nAnd any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos\nWill be ignored\n'Cause my heart is yours\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nDon't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nBut they can't take what's ours\nThey can't take what's ours\n\n[Outro]\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours"}, {"title": "If This Was a Movie", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLast night, I heard my own heart beating\nSounded like footsteps on my stairs\nSix months gone and I'm still reaching\nEven though I know you're not there\nI was playing back a thousand memories, baby\nThinkin' 'bout everything we've been through\nMaybe I've been going back too much lately\nWhen time stood still and I had you\n\n[Chorus]\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know people change and these things happen\nBut I remember how it was back then\nWrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing\n'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them\nNow I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street\nFlashback to the night when you said to me\n\"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you\"\nNot before I knew how much I had to lose\n\n[Chorus]\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on\nI've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone\nI just want it back the way it was before\nAnd I just want to see you back at my front door\n\n[Chorus - Variation]\nAnd I say, \"Come back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would before you said it's not that easy\nBefore the fight, before I locked you out\"\nBut I take it all back now\n\n[Chorus]\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou would, you would if this was a movie\nStand in the rain outside till I came out\nCome back, come back, come back to me like\nYou could, you could if you just said you're sorry\nI know that we could work it out somehow\nBut if this was a movie you'd be here by now\n\n[Outro]\nYou'd be here by now\nIt's not the kind of ending you want to see now\nBaby, what about the ending?\nOh, I thought you'd be here by now\nThought you'd be here by now"}, {"title": "Superman", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTall, dark, and superman\nHe puts papers in his briefcase and drives away\nTo save the world or go to work\nIt's the same thing to me\nHe's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition\nI wonder if he knows how much that I miss him\nI hang on every word you say, yay\nAnd you smile and say, \"How are you?\u201d\nI say, \"Just fine\"\nI always forget to tell you, I love you\nI love you forever\n\n[Chorus]\nI watch superman fly away\nYou've got a busy day today\nGo save the world, I'll be around\nI watch superman fly away\nCome back, I'll be with you someday\nI'll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\n\n[Verse 2]\nTall, dark and beautiful\nHe's complicated, he's irrational\nBut I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah\nSomething in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'\nHe's not all bad like his reputation\nAnd I can't hear one single word they say\nAnd you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay\nI always forget to tell you I love you\nI loved you from the very first day\n\n[Chorus]\nI watch superman fly away\nYou've got a busy day today\nGo save the world, I'll be around\nI watch superman fly away\nCome back, I'll be with you someday\nI'll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I watch you fly around the world\nAnd I hope you don't save some other girl\nDon't forget, don't forget about me\nI'm far away, but I never let you go\nI'm love-struck and looking out the window\nDon't forget, don't forget where I'll be\n\n[Breakdown]\nRight here, wishing the flowers were from you\nWishing the card was from you\nWishing the call was from you\n'Cause I loved you from the very first day\n\n[Chorus - Variation]\nI watch superman fly away\nYou've got a busy day today\nGo save the world, I'll be around\nForever and ever here\nI watch superman fly away\nI swear, I'll be with you someday\nI'll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\n\n[Outro]\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nWhen you come back
