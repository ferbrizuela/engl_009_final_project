## Data Analysis Folder 

This folder contains the workbooks in which I conducted the analysis for my project.

* General Analysis: `analysis_era_1`, `analysis_era_2` and `analysis_era_3`. In these notebooks, I carried out general analyses such as word frequency, average word count, type-token-ratio, and simple visualizations of word frequency. 
* KWIC: `kiwc_era_1`, `kiwc_era_2`, and `kiwc_era_3`. I used these notebooks to conduct a "Key Word In Context" analysis. I chose some target words and looking into the context of the usage of these words in my corpora.
* Keyness: `keyness_analysis`. In this notebook, I conducted a keyness analysis of words in each corpora to figure out distinctive words in one corpus in relation to another corpus.
